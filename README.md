# About this repository

This repository holds OpenSCAD modules for frequently used 3D printer parts. The modules should be written in such a way as to make it easy to incorporate them into larger designs for specific labware.

# What is OpenSCAD?

[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is an open-source cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac OSX) 3D CAD modeller based on the OpenSCAD programming language. As a programmable modeller, it is not a drag & drop interactive 3D designer but an actual code-based solution to making complex 3D models. It has a slightly steeper learning curve than drag & drop software like [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/), however, once familiar with its basic syntax, it is immensely powerful and allows for complex, 100% reproducible 3D designs that are easy to customize and share across designs by writing them as modules. Because OpenSCAD designs are literally just text-based script files, they are also perfect for collaboration and version control on GitHub.
